I want you to create the following product: 
Take a Microsoft Excel 97-2003 Worksheet and perform the following: 


1. Delete the top five rows 
2. Delete the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 10th columns simultaneously (so the columns don't shift and make them delete the wrong columns) 
3. Remove the values from A1-F2 (after everything has been moved) 
4. Fill in values of "Customer, Sold-To, Legal Name, Pkg, Platn, PDL" for the columns from A2-F2

//REMOVAL STAGE
5. Go through the Plant column and highlight all rows red that have the following text anywhere in the string
 - MEMORY 
 - SIP 
 - FPS 
 - Molded MEMS 

6. Go through same column and highlight rows red that have the following text: 
 - CABGA
 - BGA
 - SCSP 

7. Now go through, and highlight all cells that include the text "test" (either capitalized or uncapitalized" that immediately follow a red highlighted cell. Highlight these yellow. Otherwise highlight green. For example:

MEMORY - red
TEST - yellow
Testing - yellow 
test jp - yellow 
BGA - green
test - green
TEST - green 
SIP - red
